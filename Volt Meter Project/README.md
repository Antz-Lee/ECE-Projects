# Volt Meter Project

The purpose of this project is to be able to create a voltmeter that displays a max input of 45 volts on an LCD display by using 
an ATmega328pb chip. The execution of this project uses C and Assembly programming languages by using Atmel Studio. The schematic design 
and PCB layout of the project is also built on the Eeagle program while other components were circuit design implementation.
