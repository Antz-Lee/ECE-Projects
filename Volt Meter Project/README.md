# Volt-Meter-Project
Creating a voltmeter that displays the input voltage on an LCD display by using an ATmega328pb chip. The link below is a youtube video that focuses 
on the structure behind building a Voltmeter with an Atmega328PB microchip. The video also contains a live demo of the voltmeter that displays the 
voltage value of 9V batteries connected in series with a max voltage of 36Volts.
