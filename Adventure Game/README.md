# Adventure Game Project 

This repository contains a C# code implentation of the early 1980's text based video game, "Adventure Game". 
The single player game is driven by exploration and puzzle solving in an interactive story mode adventure. 
The game uses the command window of the PC through a series of text-based controls and parsers that is able to 
act as commands for the players action throughout the game.
