# Finance Datase - Personal Project

This is one of the personal projects that i did during Quarantine. Overall, this project is a Finance Database that 
uses Google Sheets and Google API (Google script) to give the user a monthly and yearly report of there finances.
The Google Sheet intergrates with the Google API to create a sort of user experience that also include a desktop application that 
uses Python and C programming language. Hope you enjoy looking through this 2020 Quarantine Project!
